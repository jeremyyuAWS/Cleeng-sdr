Runtime Security: Detect and prevent threats in running containers with zero performance impact using our eBPF-based monitoring\n\n2. Compliance Automation: Automatically enforce and document compliance with {{complianceStandard}} in your Kubernetes environment\n\n3. Supply Chain Protection: Secure your entire container lifecycle from build to runtime with continuous vulnerability management\n\nWe recently helped {{similarCompany}} in the {{industry}} space implement these controls, resulting in an 85% reduction in security incidents and 60% less time spent on compliance reporting.\n\nWould a brief 15-minute call make sense to explore if these approaches could deliver similar results for {{company}}?\n\nBest regards,\n[Your name]",
